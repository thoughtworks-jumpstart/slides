## Getting started

Clone the repository and install all dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Create a new slide deck

Within the `src` folder, select or create a new folder for a topic (e.g. `git`, `javascript`, `react`) and create a Markdown file for your deck (e.g. `react.md`).

## Build your slide deck in watch mode

It is recommended that you run `npm run start` so you can build your slide deck in watch mode to ensure that your slides are always built before you commit them.

## Update README

This README serves as the entry point. Update the content with a link to your deck. Be sure to follow the format `topics/{your-topic}/{your-title}.html` (e.g. `[React]("topics/react/react.html")`).

## Preview your slides

Install the Marp extension for VS Code then view your slide as a regular Markdown preview.
